description: "Tasks that generate synthetic records on demand or emit them continuously via triggers."
body: "Use `Generate` to produce a single value inline or batches saved to storage, and `Trigger`/`RealtimeTrigger` to schedule or stream executions. Each task requires a `generator` definition (e.g., JSON, string, bytes); tune `batchSize`, `store`, `throughput`, and `reportingInterval` to shape output volume and persistence."
